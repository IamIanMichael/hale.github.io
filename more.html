                        The term "broken sonnet" itself suggests a love that doesn't conform to traditional expectations or ideals.
                         The lyrics depict a relationship that may be flawed or faced with challenges, 
                         but it remains deeply passionate and genuine. It expresses the idea that love can be messy, 
                         full of ups and downs, and still hold a special place in one's heart. It's a
                         reflection on the complexities of human emotions and the enduring nature of love despite its
                          imperfections.</td>

                    "Alon" by Hale is a song about the transient and ever-changing nature 
                    of life and relationships. The term "Alon" means "wave" in English, 
                    and the song often uses water and the ocean as metaphors. It conveys 
                    the idea that life's challenges, just like waves, come and go. 
                    The lyrics suggest that even in the face of difficulties and uncertainty, 
                    one can find solace and strength in the ebb and flow of life, much like the constancy 
                    of the ocean's waves. The song is a reflection on the impermanence of 
                    life and the need to embrace change with resilience and acceptance.</td>

                         "just a moment" in English. The lyrics reflect a sense of urgency and longing to
                          make the most of a brief and precious time with someone special. The song conveys 
                          the idea that some experiences are so meaningful and profound that they feel like 
                          they pass too quickly, and the singer wishes to make the most of those moments.
